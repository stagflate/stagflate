- 👋 Hi, I’m @stagflate
- 👀 I’m interested in beginning building projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to set up projects/environment variables/dependencies. I am very new to project building! I only know theoretical language stuff from school; I can't get anything to run from scratch yet!
- 💞️ I’m looking to get help beginning on basic projects that will help me reach my goal of building apps from the ground up.
- 📫 How to reach me: right here on GitHub!

This was added from github desktop!
